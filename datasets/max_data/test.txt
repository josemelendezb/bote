However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[([38], [52], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [7], 'NEG')]
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[([24], [12], 'NEG')]

A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .####[([2, 3, 4, 5], [1], 'NEU')]
